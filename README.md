Notes to Grader: 
The goal of the game is to run through the maze and collect yellow blocks. The spawn randomly. If you want to create a shortcut, you can punch 1 block to destory it.

If for some reason the game doesn't display click the canvas area. That should make it display.

I used Copilot and ChatGPT in this assignment.
